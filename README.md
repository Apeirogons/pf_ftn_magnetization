We want to increase the magnetizability of ferritin derived from P. furiosus, however, we only have mutations increasing magnetizability in E. coli. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126674/figure/f2/

To generalize this, we want to find areas of high similarity between P. furiosus and E. coli ferritin, which would be good starting points to induce mutations to increase the magnetizability of the former.

Sequences: 2JD7 and 2JD8 are PfFtn, all else are EcFtn
